<h2 center>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<dl>
	<dt><b>What can I do within this environment?</b><dt>   
	<dd>This environment allows you to visualize the 
	problem set, submit solutions for the problems, ask
	questions to the jury,  see all submissions with evaluation
	results, and the current contest ranking.</dd>
<p>

	<dt><b>How should the program read its input data? How
	should the results of a program be written?</b><dt>
	<dd>
	Input data is passed to the process <i>standard input</i> and
	results must be written to the <i>standard output</i>.
	</dd>

<p>


	<dt><b>I tried to submit a solution and got the message
	"Program with an invalid extension"!</b></dt>
	<dd>You have to submit the source code for your program. A
	submission gets accepted for evaluation only if it has a file 
        extension corresponding to the one of the accepted languages 
        for the contest. 
	</dd>
<p>

	<dt><b>What languages and compilers are currently available?</b></dt>
	<dd>
	For this contest the analyzer accepts the following
	languages and uses the following compilers:
	<p>
	<center>
	<table border="1"  cellpadding="10">
	<tr>
		<th>Language</th>
		<th>Compiler</th>
		<th>Version</th>
		<th>Command line</th>
		<th>Extension</th>
	</tr>

$languages
	</table>
	</center>
	</dd>
<p>


	<dt><b>What's the meaning of the evaluation messages?</b></dt>
	<dd>The evaluation messages are as follows:<br>
<p>
<table border=1 cellpadding="10">
<tr>
<td> <b>Accepted</b>:</td>
<td>your program passed all tests and is accepted as correct;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Compile Time Error</b>:</td>
<td>the system was not able to successfully
   compile your program; the compiler returned an error or warning;
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Runtime Error</b>:</td>
<td>your program "crashed", i. e. it exited prematurely due to a
run-time error;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Time Limit Exceeded</b>:</td>
<td>your program did not finish within the  given amount of time;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Wrong Answer</b>:</td>
<td>your program run through one or more test cases
   without a run-time error but the output did not match the expected
   output;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Presentation Error</b>:</td>
<td>the output seems to be correct but it is  not presented in the
required format. Since it is not always easy 
   to distinguish this message from the wrong answer message, it is
   only sent in obvious cases; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Invalid Submission</b>:</td>
<td> your submission does not comply with expected extensions; or attempt to submit without following the interface; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Output Limit Exceeded</b>:</td>
<td> your program generates an output too long for this problem; the limits are dependent on the test cases, but are usually low (limit is around 100KB); </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Program Size Exceeded</b>:</td>
<td> your program is too long and will not be considered (limit is around 100KB); </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Requires Reevaluation</b>:</td>
<td> for some reason your program has to be re-evaluated; </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Invalid Function</b>:</td>
<td> your program violates a contest rule
   like calling non-standard libraries; it may be terminating
   with <code>exit(1)</code> or even <code>return 1</code>, or a similar 
   construct indicating an error in execute.
</td>
</tr>
       </table>

	<dt><b>There are any limits enforced by the judging system?</b></dt>
	<dd>	
	There are several limits that if reached will penalize you:

	</dd>
<p>

	<dt><b>When I press the submit button nothing happens!</b></dt>
	<dd>You must check the cache policy being used by your
	browser. Pages should be retrieved from the server every time
	some update to the page is detected. If the pages are never
	requested from the server, they will not be updated in your
	browser. In <i>Mozilla</i> and <i>Netscape</i> check the
	"Edit" | "Preferences." | "Advanced" | "Cache" menu and
	choose "Every time (I view the page)".</dd>
<p>
	<dt><b>The format of the interface has an odd appearance</b></dt>
	<dd>Try choosing a smaller font ("Edit" | "Preferences." |
	"Appearance"  "Fonts" ). Alternatively, try to remove the
	navigation and personal bars in the browser (menu "View"). </dd>
<p>
	<dt><b>I pressed the "Submit" button and got the message
	"Unspecified Program".</b></dt>
	<dd>You must select the file with the source program. Press 
        "Browse...." to open a file selection box or write the
	path-name for the file in the box to the left of the this button.
	</dd>
<p>
	<dt><b>How can I ask a question regarding a problem specification?</b></dt>
	<dd>Press the "Ask" button in the upper right corner. A form
	will appear where you may write your question and send it to
	the jury of the contest. Before pressing the "Ask" button you 
        should check whether you are selecting the right problem.</dd>
